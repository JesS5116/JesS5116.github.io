## Was there money before?

The saying “money is what moves the world” is well known. However, when we want to define the concept "money", we realize that it is more complicated than it seems, it may be precious metals, papers with a certain written value or an abstraction of the non-existent that is stored somewhere in the bank or, in recent years, in the information network distributed throughout the world.

Barter was the first form of payment in the world, it consisted of the exchange of two material goods between two people: the buyer and the seller. For example, a farmer who had beef or lamb could go to the city in search of tools, offering his meat as payment. In this way, a hammer could cost two kilos of beef or a kilo of lamb meat. There was no defined price for the products. Also, the person selling the hammer might not need the meat, so buying the tools would be very difficult.

Due to these problems, it was decided to use precious metals as a means of payment in shops. It could be in the form of dust, nuggets, pieces, blocks, among others. One of the problems was that the value was measured by weight, so it was a complicated task to measure at every moment or break the metal into the desired parts. In addition, the forgeries were easy to make, since there was no regulation on the specifications that the metal should have. The materials that were used were gold, silver and copper, so the extraction activity of these was important at this time. In addition, the need to transport the dust or the pieces of the metal was very uncomfortable. It had to be carried in bags or containers that could easily be lost or stolen. With all its problems, the form of payment seemed to be the correct one, if not the most efficient, but the money could be saved and preserved without losing its value. Because of this, the process of minting coins began.

Initially, transactions were not organized or written down for record keeping. This is how the loan of money became an essential mechanism for development, especially in agriculture, where payments can be guaranteed with future harvests. Also, there was no record of the loans and interest calculations, so anyone could say that they were owed 100 gold coins and no one could deny or affirm it. The first records of this type date from the time of the Mesopotamian culture, a place between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, present-day area of ​​Iraq and Syria. This is how mathematics, writing and a set of laws that regulate economic relations (the Hammurabi code) arose. Transactions between people began to be registered for the control and proper management of resources.

Las monedas ahora circulaban por las calles y paseaban de comercio a comercio; estos pequeños trozos de metal tenían un diseño distintivo en su superficie para indicar su valor y evitar falsificaciones. Pero, como ya es costumbre en la historia del dinero, había un problema: el peso de las monedas. Cuando se tenían muchas monedas, se necesitaba bastante espacio para guardarles y bastantes medios de transporte para llevarlas de un lugar a otro. En consecuencia, inició la utilización de los llamados billetes, los cuales incluían diseños distintivos únicos para evitar falsificaciones. De esta manera, se tenía un sistema económico que funcionaba en cada rincón del mundo.

## Capitalism and money virtualization

The most drastic changes in our money management and the deep virtualization of monetary flows appeared with the formation of capitalism. Whether we like it or not, that is the current economic system and its main actors are no longer individuals but legal entities: companies. A company has much more freedom than a natural person and can incorporate more capital for its development.

Let's consider an example. Suppose Emma's company has an idea of ​​how to create virtual security software so there is no risk of hacking, but she doesn't have enough money to invest and start building her idea, since it costs $100,000. On the other hand, there is Diana who is opening a business to lend money or keep it safe (a bank), but she only has $20,000. Then there is Cecilia, who would like to keep $50,000 in a safe place to avoid theft, because it has already happened to her grandfather who, for keeping the money under the bed, lost it all in a robbery while he was chasing a donkey that had escaped. In this way, Cecilia keeps her money with Diana and can keep it away from theft or unforeseen events, and also receive interest.

Now Diana has half the money Emma needs to start her idea, so, even knowing that she doesn't have the full amount, she offers Emma to lend her $100,000 MX so that her idea can go to market. At this moment, the three parts of this operation are winning, Cecilia can save her money and avoid theft, Diana has money to lend Emma and generate profits from this loan, and Emma has enough money for her idea to go to market . How is it possible that Diana can make a loan that exceeds the money she has? Isn't that silly? On the one hand, if Emma's business fails, it's going to result in a financial crisis. However, if we do not allow banks to lend more money, the economy stops, so Emma cannot open her business, develop her life and that of others by offering new jobs. To stimulate development, Banco Diana has the ability to lend up to 10 times its total capital. In our case we have:

It is important to highlight a point in this example, Emma is not selling a company or a product, she is selling an idea. She sells her knowledge and her skills to develop a product and it can be done thanks to the loan from the bank (Diana) of money that does not exist. This means that the idea of a virtual security software acquired all the value this time. The idea and vision of the future is what is important and what is marketed, not money.

Before we continue, we want to emphasize one point: the total amount of money is not defined. Even for a person, the amount of money they have at their disposal does not appear physically, but is in debit and/or credit accounts guaranteed by the bank. In this way you have money that does not really exist but that the bank ensures that you have. On the other hand, the amount of wealth that one has not only depends on physical or imaginary money, but also depends on the actions, houses, buildings, technology, among others, that one owns. As we see in the previous example, money appears thanks to the needs of development. It's just a mechanism to promote business ideas.

## Your money inside of a computer

In the last 10 years, a new information blockchain technology has emerged that promises to drastically change the global economic system. And as a result, cryptocurrencies appeared. Surely you have heard of people who became millionaires overnight because they had saved the type of cryptocurrency called bitcoin, since its maximum historical price has been more than 68 thousand dollars [1].

What is a cryptocurrency and what is it for? We have already discussed that even in ancient Mesopotamia the importance of recording financial transactions appeared. Technically, if we have a universal, secure and reliable registry for everyone in this world, it is no longer necessary to spend resources and time on production and distribution of coins and notes. We no longer need money in its vulgar form. The fortune and capital of a person is his history, his past financial transactions, and the record of these transactions defines the amount of cryptocurrencies he has. For its part, cryptocurrencies are a digital representation of money, which stores transactions in a secure registry called “blockchain” in English. However, you lose the advantage of lending more money than you have. Here a person or company cannot issue more cryptocurrencies than they have in their possession, although some companies are trying to incorporate the cryptocurrency lending mechanism so that you can borrow up to 50% of the current value of your cryptocurrencies, leaving your cryptocurrencies as collateral. current cryptocurrencies.

The “blockchain” (chain of blocks, for its translation into Spanish) is a technology that uses the computer security methods of coding and encryption, or electronic cryptography, to provide security for cryptocurrency transactions. The blockchain has three components: transaction data, hash referring to the current transaction, and hash referring to the past transaction. The hash is a cryptographic technique that provides data security, it is a string of numbers and characters that ensures the veracity of a file. This small hash serves as a fingerprint of the file and has the property that it changes drastically with each element in the data file that is changed. Also, each transaction has a unique hash. Each person participating in a transaction has their private hash, which is unique to each person and is used to authorize transactions (it's like a digital signature). There is also a public hash, which is a digital signature to keep track of the transaction and guarantee for other people that the transaction is secure.

The first component, transaction data, refers to the information that describes the action that was performed. The hash referred to the current transaction is generated at the time of the transaction and is unique for each one of them. The hash referred to the past transaction refers to the hash of the action before the current one; but, if you don't have any past actions, the hash will be a string of zeros.

Let's give an example. Alice and Bob want to transfer cryptocurrency to each other, so they turn to blockchain technology. When Alice pays Bob 10 cryptocurrencies, a block is generated on the blockchain that contains the transaction data (Alice pays Bob 10 cryptocurrencies), the hash referring to the current transaction (for example, qwerty5116! #%), and a hash referring to the past transaction, which in this case will be a string of zeros for not having a past action (0000000000000). Since Alice has paid Bob, let's move on to Bob's perspective. When he receives the payment, a new block is generated in the same chain of blocks that contains the transaction data (Bob receives 10 cryptocurrencies from Alice), a hash referring to the current transaction (for example hytdol5%46!#9) and a hash referring to the past transaction, which in this case will be the hash of the block that is generated from Alice referring to the current transaction (qwerty5116!#%). These two blocks that have been generated are connected to each other, providing monitoring and security to the transaction; in this way a chain of blocks has been created.

*Figura 1: Blockchain of Alice and Bob transaction.*

This “blockchain” is in the possession of Alice and Bob, but it is not enough for the transaction to be valid, it has to be verified through one of the following two processes. The first is the so-called proof of work, which consists of guessing the first characters of the hash referring to the current transaction by solving complex mathematical problems. This process is quite complicated and energy-intensive, since great computational power is needed to validate the largest number of transactions in the shortest possible time. The people who perform the "proof of work" are called miners, and the first to guess the characters, validates the transaction and takes a commission to his pocket, generating a new block in the chain of blocks that refers to the validation. of the transaction, having the transaction data (Validation), a hash referring to the current transaction (for example fhglfh55$%&/!) and a hash referring to the past transaction, which will be the hash of the current transaction of the block generated by Bob (hytdol5%46!#9). In this way, the “blockchain” has three blocks: the one generated by Alice, the one generated by Bob and the one generated by the miner to validate the transaction; this chain of blocks is now held by Alice, Bob and the miner (figure 1).

The second way to verify the transaction is with the proof of stake method, which consists of people who want to carry out this process deposit cryptocurrencies that are blocked and stored in the network of the cryptocurrencies (information system throughout the internet created specifically for this type of cryptocurrency). In this way, transactions can be verified just by having the digital currencies stored in the network, eliminating the large energy consumption of the previous method. The people who carry out this process are called validators, and the choice of who will verify the transaction directly depends on the amount of cryptocurrencies that you have blocked in the network; the more you have, the more opportunities you have.

As we have seen in this example, intermediaries are not needed to carry out the transaction. Banks are not required and all data and cryptocurrencies are stored in the decentralized computer network, and thus does not depend on any government. Another advantage of this new technology is that it does not allow you to spend more money than you have. Unfortunately, some restrictions result from these two advantages. Cryptocurrencies are not guaranteed by a government authority and therefore are not accepted by all businesses, and have difficulty promoting economic development. This results in great volatility of cryptocurrencies. However, it seems to be a monetary system of the future and it is important to consider its energy efficiency. Finally, the biggest concern of the cryptocurrency market is that its mining, essential for the security of the system, consumes a huge amount of electrical energy.

## The energy consumption of what does not exist

Let's put the energy consumed in perspective. The energy consumption in the world in 2019 was 173,340 TWh [2] (the TWh unit of measurement refers to one trillion, or one million million watts per hour). According to data from the University of Cambridge, United Kingdom, the average annual energy used by the bitcoin cryptocurrency network in the year 2020 is approximately 25,000 TWh [3], which is equivalent to 14% of the total world energy consumed. in 2019. It's huge. In Mexico, only 307.5 TWh were consumed in 2020 [4], so the energy consumed by the bitcoin network in 2020 is more than 80 times what all of Mexico consumed in the same year, see Figure 2.

![graph](/assets/img/posts/consumo_energetico.jpg "Energy consumption"){:height="320px" width="800"}
*Figura 2: Comparison of annual electricity consumption.*

Another alarming aspect is that the electricity consumption of the cryptocurrency industry is growing drastically. The consumption of electronic databases is not negligible either. We can talk about traditional and hyper-scale databases. The traditional ones are characterized by storing the information in a physical way, basically you can imagine a traditional database as they paint it in the movies, full of giant machines and cables where all the information is stored. Although we imagine the storage of data in the cloud virtually, in reality, there is always a physical machine that protects the information and consumes energy. Hyperscale databases are basically like traditional databases, but on a large scale, so they are only used by digital giant companies. The total energy consumed by the databases in 2020 was between 200 and 250 TWh, which is equivalent to 1% of the energy consumed worldwide [5], or between 65% and 81% of the energy consumed in Mexico in that period. same year, see Figure 2. This is a problem that has to be faced, since the new technologies that are emerging (quantum computing and cryptocurrencies in some cases) need databases.

As a result, cryptocurrency and blockchain technology leaves a huge carbon footprint, which is a universal indicator that reflects the amount of planet-damaging gases emitted by an individual, organization, technology, event, or product, and is not can ignore. As we have seen, bitcoin mining uses 144.16 TWh per year [3], so the use of fossil fuels such as oil, natural gas or coal to generate electricity is not the sustainable method for the Earth and its inhabitants. Experts have proposed the use of renewable energies for the processes required in cryptocurrencies (such as mining and databases where the information is stored), reducing the emissions of gases that are harmful to the environment and the cost of electricity. It should be noted that the daily fluctuations that some renewable energy sources have are not that important for cryptocurrency technology. One can always mine in places on Earth where it is sunny or windy at the time of mining.

Not only renewable energy can help blockchain technology, but it can be the other way around. Electric power generation and distribution companies have begun to use the chain of blocks to verify if the power generation is 100% renewable [6], eliminating intermediaries and guaranteeing the veracity and transparency of the data.

In addition to renewable energy, there is another technology that can help make cryptocurrency transactions safe and fast: quantum computing. This technology has barely 40 years of research and development, so there are no practical applications in cryptocurrency issues. However, experts in the fields of economics, physics, mathematics, medicine, chemistry, and biology have high expectations for the achievements of this technology, since the supremacy of quantum computers over traditional computing was already demonstrated by Google three years ago [ 7].

Quantum computing makes use of properties of quantum physics and promises to reduce the energy consumption of databases around the world and the creation of new supercomputers, computing devices with greater capacity than normal desktop or laptop computers, that can perform tasks mathematics that until now are unfeasible. In addition, it offers high encryption security in each of the operations, so its use in the chain of blocks could benefit energy consumption, security and speed of transactions.

Although the use of renewable energy and quantum computing sounds promising for cryptocurrencies, there are several barriers that need to be overcome first. The world still does not know how to regulate cryptocurrencies and how to guarantee their effectiveness, so their daily use is not very close. In addition, the volatility in their prices is a latent problem that has to be solved.

Cryptocurrencies are an important monetary alternative for a radical change in the world economic system. However, governmental and legal barriers have to be overcome first for it to be a viable economic system. Simultaneously, work must be done on technologies that help reduce environmental impact and increase transaction security, with renewable energy and quantum computing being promising options.
