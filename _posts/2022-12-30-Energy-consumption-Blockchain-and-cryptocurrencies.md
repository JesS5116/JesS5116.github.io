## Was there money before?

![Porky with money](/assets/img/posts/cerdito.jpg "Porky with money")
The saying “money is what moves the world” is well known. However, when we want to define the concept "money", we realize that it is more complicated than it seems, it may be precious metals, papers with a certain written value or an abstraction of the non-existent that is stored somewhere in the bank or, in recent years, in the information network distributed throughout the world.

Barter was the first form of payment in the world, it consisted of the exchange of two material goods between two people: the buyer and the seller. For example, a farmer who had beef or lamb could go to the city in search of tools, offering his meat as payment. In this way, a hammer could cost two kilos of beef or a kilo of lamb meat. There was no defined price for the products. Also, the person selling the hammer might not need the meat, so buying the tools would be very difficult.

Due to these problems, it was decided to use precious metals as a means of payment in shops. It could be in the form of dust, nuggets, pieces, blocks, among others. One of the problems was that the value was measured by weight, so it was a complicated task to measure at every moment or break the metal into the desired parts. In addition, the forgeries were easy to make, since there was no regulation on the specifications that the metal should have. The materials that were used were gold, silver and copper, so the extraction activity of these was important at this time. In addition, the need to transport the dust or the pieces of the metal was very uncomfortable. It had to be carried in bags or containers that could easily be lost or stolen. With all its problems, the form of payment seemed to be the correct one, if not the most efficient, but the money could be saved and preserved without losing its value. Because of this, the process of minting coins began.

Initially, transactions were not organized or written down for record keeping. This is how the loan of money became an essential mechanism for development, especially in agriculture, where payments can be guaranteed with future harvests. Also, there was no record of the loans and interest calculations, so anyone could say that they were owed 100 gold coins and no one could deny or affirm it. The first records of this type date from the time of the Mesopotamian culture, a place between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, present-day area of ​​Iraq and Syria. This is how mathematics, writing and a set of laws that regulate economic relations (the Hammurabi code) arose. Transactions between people began to be registered for the control and proper management of resources.

Las monedas ahora circulaban por las calles y paseaban de comercio a comercio; estos pequeños trozos de metal tenían un diseño distintivo en su superficie para indicar su valor y evitar falsificaciones. Pero, como ya es costumbre en la historia del dinero, había un problema: el peso de las monedas. Cuando se tenían muchas monedas, se necesitaba bastante espacio para guardarles y bastantes medios de transporte para llevarlas de un lugar a otro. En consecuencia, inició la utilización de los llamados billetes, los cuales incluían diseños distintivos únicos para evitar falsificaciones. De esta manera, se tenía un sistema económico que funcionaba en cada rincón del mundo.

## Capitalism and money virtualization

The most drastic changes in our money management and the deep virtualization of monetary flows appeared with the formation of capitalism. Whether we like it or not, that is the current economic system and its main actors are no longer individuals but legal entities: companies. A company has much more freedom than a natural person and can incorporate more capital for its development.

Let's consider an example. Suppose Emma's company has an idea of ​​how to create virtual security software so there is no risk of hacking, but she doesn't have enough money to invest and start building her idea, since it costs $100,000. On the other hand, there is Diana who is opening a business to lend money or keep it safe (a bank), but she only has $20,000. Then there is Cecilia, who would like to keep $50,000 in a safe place to avoid theft, because it has already happened to her grandfather who, for keeping the money under the bed, lost it all in a robbery while he was chasing a donkey that had escaped. In this way, Cecilia keeps her money with Diana and can keep it away from theft or unforeseen events, and also receive interest.

Now Diana has half the money Emma needs to start her idea, so, even knowing that she doesn't have the full amount, she offers Emma to lend her $100,000 MX so that her idea can go to market. At this moment, the three parts of this operation are winning, Cecilia can save her money and avoid theft, Diana has money to lend Emma and generate profits from this loan, and Emma has enough money for her idea to go to market . How is it possible that Diana can make a loan that exceeds the money she has? Isn't that silly? On the one hand, if Emma's business fails, it's going to result in a financial crisis. However, if we do not allow banks to lend more money, the economy stops, so Emma cannot open her business, develop her life and that of others by offering new jobs. To stimulate development, Banco Diana has the ability to lend up to 10 times its total capital. In our case we have:

It is important to highlight a point in this example, Emma is not selling a company or a product, she is selling an idea. She sells her knowledge and her skills to develop a product and it can be done thanks to the loan from the bank (Diana) of money that does not exist. This means that the idea of a virtual security software acquired all the value this time. The idea and vision of the future is what is important and what is marketed, not money.

Before we continue, we want to emphasize one point: the total amount of money is not defined. Even for a person, the amount of money they have at their disposal does not appear physically, but is in debit and/or credit accounts guaranteed by the bank. In this way you have money that does not really exist but that the bank ensures that you have. On the other hand, the amount of wealth that one has not only depends on physical or imaginary money, but also depends on the actions, houses, buildings, technology, among others, that one owns. As we see in the previous example, money appears thanks to the needs of development. It's just a mechanism to promote business ideas.

## Your money inside of a computer

In the last 10 years, a new information blockchain technology has emerged that promises to drastically change the global economic system. And as a result, cryptocurrencies appeared. Surely you have heard of people who became millionaires overnight because they had saved the type of cryptocurrency called bitcoin, since its maximum historical price has been more than 68 thousand dollars [1].
